A slider is a sequence of frames that can be accessed in order. To create a slider, input basic HTML code and add radio buttons for the frames using the "type" attribute. Design each frame in sequence, adjust their positions using "margin-left", and use radio buttons and control labels. Images can be included in each frame to reduce browser memory usage and computational power. To create a slideshow using only HTML and CSS, set up a container with radio inputs, design slides with unique frame classes, customize content, use CSS for smooth sliding effects, adjust the '.inner' class's'margin-left' property, implement control buttons and bullets with labels, and ensure responsiveness by adjusting media queries for smaller screens.
